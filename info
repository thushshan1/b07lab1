developing a class called polynomial which has various methods such as add, evaluate, and hasRoot
add: adds to Polynomial objects
evaluate: calculates the answer to the polynomail given a particular value
hasRoot: determines if a value is a root of the polynomial
the field is a double array
has a no-argument constructor which sets polynomial to zero
